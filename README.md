Create a MongoDB instance on MongoDB Altas

Add the mongoDB endpoint in the server.js to connect to the DB; No need to pre-set the schema in the MongoDB Altas.

Change the request cookie owner, so that the queried data is not empty

use `npm run start` to start Node+Express/backend app

Test the API in postman: Once the server is on, test get/post/put/delete API in postman
ex: http://localhost:8000/api/pokemon
localhost:8000 for the backend
localhost:5173 for the front end

use `npm install` and then run `npm run dev` to start React/frontend app
